### Monday CAD Practice

On this day, we practiced how to do sketches in Autodesk. I am still quite confused to many of the details, such as how to put a contraint on something, when to do that, and what should I put constraints on versus what I should not constrain. 

### Wednesday 

Failed but still interesting attempt in operating the solar tracker 

On this Wednesday, Tyler, Catherine and I tried to wire up the solar tracker to make it work. 

During the process, we soldered the wires and tried to connect them to a circuit board to make start off the solar tracker. 

Unfortunately, after we fully connected everything, the sensors did not report credible codes, which meant there were something wrong with the breadboard we connected our sensors to. 

Instead of reporting codes that reflected the amount of light the sensors received, we continously saw signs of malfunction from our end on Arduino.
