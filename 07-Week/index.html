### Monday

Sunny day for testing!

We had a week of good weather! So we were able to test out whether the bounce mirror (the one we currently have was cut from the center of the disc, which is concaved) 

Here are the images:

Results from the experiment:

We realized that the focal point of the reflector was around 6 inches. We used a concave shaped bounce mirror, which was cut off of the center of the fresnel reflector. We realized that it was hard to match the focal point of the reflector and the bounce mirror, which was required if a concave mirror was used. 

Thus, we decided that we should use a convex mirror instead, in which case we could place it anywhere along the cone shaped path of light reflected by the reflector, and the light would be reflected back to the light pipe by the bounce mirror. 

### Wednesday 

Testing gold foil and aluminum foil

On this day we tested the gold foil to compare it with the aluminum foil.

As you can see from the pictures, temperature of the surfaces of the gold foil rised significantly after being placed under the sun and the sky for a while. This meant that it was not good at reflecting light, possibly infared since it directly relates to temperature. If the material absorbs wave instead of reflects it, it is not a good candidate for our purposes.
