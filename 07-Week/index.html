### Monday

Sunny day for testing!

We had a week of good weather! So we were able to test out whether the bounce mirror (the one we currently have was cut from the center of the disc, which is concaved) 

Here are the images:

### Wednesday 

Testing gold foil and aluminum foil

On this day we tested the gold foil to compare it with the aluminum foil.

As you can see from the pictures, temperature of the surfaces of the gold foil rised significantly after being placed under the sun and the sky for a while. This meant that it was not good at reflecting light, possibly infared since it directly relates to temperature. If the material absorbs wave instead of reflects it, it is not a good candidate for our purposes.
