### Monday 11/7

On monday we separated into groups working on different parts of the project. I joined the group working on tracking and motor controlling the Azimuthal degree of freedom. We taled about how to make the light pipe move freely relative to the drum in the horizontal direction and decided that we should place some kind of bearings onto an additional layer between the light pipe and the drum. We mostly worked on hand sketches.



a few sketches when brainstorming what the bottom part of the solar cooker might look like:
 






### Wednesday 11/9

On Wednesday we worked in fusion 360 after groups were assigned on Monday. I was working on the light pipe's CAD model. I was able to cut the pipe into two different components at different angles 

The CAD sketches I did:
