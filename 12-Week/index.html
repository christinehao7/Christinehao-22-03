### Monday Dec 5

On Monday, Catherine and I went to the architecture shop to cut the aluminum extrusion. It was a very interesting and fun experience. I really enjoyed learning about how to use these equipments and prepare materials for our prototype. I also lazer cutted the back support of the bounce mirror, which was designed to hold the bounce mirror in place above the reflection disc. Metal rds will be attached to this layer. 

Justin taught us how to safely operate the machine. We also observed the other team prepare the disc. 


Here are some pictures I took on this day:

### Wednesday Dec 7


On Wednesday, I learned how to tap holes in the aluminum extrusions. I prepared these to 8020 extrusions with holes tapped on both ends. One end is for the bearing to be attached on, which will connect the disc and the light pipe, and allow the disc to rotate in its altitude degree of freedom. 

The other end would be mounted on top of the ring holding the three stepper motors.

Here are some pictures of the process.
