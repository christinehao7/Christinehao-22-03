### Monday Dec 5

On Monday, Catherine and I went to the architecture shop to cut the aluminum extrusion. It was a very interesting and fun experience. I really enjoyed learning about how to use these equipments and prepare materials for our prototype. I also lazer cutted the back support of the bounce mirror, which was designed to hold the bounce mirror in place above the reflection disc. Metal rds will be attached to this layer. 

Here are some pictures I took on this day:

Justin taught us how to safely operate the machine. We also observed the other team prepare the disc.
