Modeling practice in CAD and attempt at putting the solar tracker

On this dayï¼Œwe first started off testing the bounce mirror and how it would work with the disc. We especially tested whether this method would work at all, by finding the concentrated light dot reflected back by the bounce mirror.

Here are some pictures of how we successfully found the concentrated light reflection made by the bounce mirror, proving that the method is applicable in our prototype.

There is a bounce miror reflection of the light concentrated by the big disc. But my camera is not showing it as clearly as it should be.

Here is the disc's original concentration.

We were also trying to find the focal point of the disc itself as well as how far we should place the bounce mirror from the disc to gain maximum yield.


Beside this, we also attempted putting together the solar tracker on this day.

Afterwards I tried to learn about CAD(which was complicated, and I needed a lot of help)

But eventually something was modeled(only with the help of Nathan and Anna)
