### Monday

On Monday we further modified our CAD models. I specifically worked on the light pipe by cutting the pipe in different angles and testing which might be an optimal model. 

We talked about other possiblities.

One of the solutions to enhance the stability of the overall object is to add a yolk onto the light pipe, which would let Anna and Catherine's degree of freedom's movement have a better grounding. 

Here was the initial sketch Justin drew on the board.

### Wednesday
Tyler, Nathan, and I worked on the CAD designs of the drum and the light pipe, specifically on the bearngs between the drum and the light pipe. I was working on the bearing and connection part, while Tyler further worked on the drum he previously sketched. 

Here are some pictures of what we did.
