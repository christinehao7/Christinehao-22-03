### Monday

On monday we separated into groups working on different parts of the project. I joined the group working on tracking and motor controlling the xy-plain's degree of freedom. 

We did a few sketches when brainstorming what the bottom part of the solar cooker might look like. 





### Wednesday

On Wednesday we worked in fusion 360 after groups were assigned on Monday. I was working on the light pipe's CAD model. I was able to cut the pipe into two different components at different angles
