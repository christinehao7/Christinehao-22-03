  ### Week 2: Experiment With All Three Commercial Solar Cookers and Sensors mit Arduino

Today, the weather was very cloudy with pretty much no sunshine, so our experiment was not so successful. Out of the three commercial solar cookers we are testing, the 1800W Concentrating Solar Cooker performed the best under the same weather conditions.

Besides testing out the we also tried out the solar sensors. 

Here are some pictures and the programming process on Arduino:
