### Last Week! --Monday

On Monday we worked on finalizing the project. Anna, Catherine, and I went to the NEET lounge to 3D print the gears for the Arizmuth degree of freedom because the holes on them were not the right sizing. 

We ran into a few problems while printing, but eventually they came out fine. 

After that we tried to figure out whether we could prepare a code that demonstrated how the altitude degree of freedom would move, without taking into account of the sensors. Catherine did most of the coding and testing for this one. 

### Wednesday

Day of the final presentation and our last class!


A little sad about our wonderful semester coming to an end. On the bright side, we had guests visiting us today, to hear our presentation on the prototype and potentially give advice to how it could be bettered. It was also a good time for us to reflect on what we did and what we learned. 


Here is a picture of our final product!
