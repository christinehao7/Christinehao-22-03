### Last Week! --Monday

On Monday we worked on finalizing the project. Anna, Catherine, and I went to the NEET lounge to 3D print the gears for the Arizmuth degree of freedom because the holes on them were not the right sizing. 

We ran into a few problems while printing, but eventually they came out fine. 

After that we tried to figure out whether we could prepare a code that demonstrated how the altitude degree of freedom would move, without taking into account of the sensors. Catherine did most of the coding and testing for this one. 

### Wednesday

Day of the final presentation and our last class!
