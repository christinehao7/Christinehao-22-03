### Monday
On monday I worked on CAD modeling the caster bearing in Fusion 360 to insert into our overall model of the solar cooker.

Because I did not fully finish during class, my plan for after class was to finish up the CAD models. 

Observations:
- I realized that my CAD models often have more sketches than needed, because I sometimes forget that I can go back and edit the previous sketches I messed up. I would start a new sketch everytime I mess up, which is not a good habit when doing a CAD model. 

I will keep working on moveing the small pieces I modelled onto the main model for Wednesday. 

### Wednesday 

Attached the bearings to the main model

We also 3D printed after we were finished with CAD.
