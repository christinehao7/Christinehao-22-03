We built a commercial solar cooker. While testing out whether it really functions, we used a silver cooking pot with the same volume of water as the comparing cooker, which was a pre-assembled cooker. We tried to boil water with this solar cooker, but the water did not boil. We believed that it was due to the fact that our utensil was not of dark color, and there was not enough time.

There were two forms of measurements. 

Here is the data collected from the temperature probes:

Starting from 16:30 to 16:55, the temperature of the pre-assembled cooker went from 23 degrees celcius to 47 degrees celcius. At the end of the experiment, we found out that the top section of the water is warmer than the bottom section. 

I also took pictures with a thermo camera. However, the data is not as accurate as the temperature probes, because the thermo camera detects the first surface it hits. 

Here are the thermo pictures of the Pre-Assembled Cooker:

Here are the thermo pictures of the Box Cooker:
