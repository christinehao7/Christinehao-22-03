  ### Week 1: Introduction 

  On Monday, we separated into groups, and I joined the battery team. Our team came up with an initial sketch of the battery. We decided to build a chimney at the top of the battery to pour in salt and as the focal point. It is located at the center of the top of the battery. We decided that we are going to stay with the same material, which is stainless steel. 

In order to carry the battery, we will build two handles either on the top or on the sides of the battery.

Below is the sketch I drew.
