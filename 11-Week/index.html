### Monday

On Monday, we focused on working in CAD. 

In CAD, I worked on this angle bracket by measuring the actual dimensions and sketching them in fusion.

This structure will be later used on the aluminum extrusion (8020). 

After class, I also worked on drawing this bearing structure in CAD.

### Wednesday Happy Thanksgiving!

It's time to start putting things together!

Today we worked on building the drum, both the inner tube and the outside. We first cut the pink foam into a shape that would fit the drum, and then we cut the inner tube, which was a bit too long. We needed the top of the tube to match the drum. Here are pictures of what they looked like pieced together. 

Beside that we also tried to lazer cut with card board to test out our model for the teeth ring for the gears and bearing casters. It was a fun day! I learned a lot of basic building skills such as cutting metal with special heavy duty scissors and how to fit a foam to the cylinder.
