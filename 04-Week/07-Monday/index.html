### Stepper Motor Continued; and Brainstorming of Structure

We continued to finish up the initial codes we wrote for the stepper motor last week. We were able to write a code that allowed the motor to essentially change directions when one of the four motors had an average higher sensor value than the other pair. 

On top of that, we also were able to set up two degrees of freedom for the motors. One degree was named "X", the other "Y". 

After we wrote the code, we also brainstormed the structure of our concentrator. We took inspiration from one of the unused designs from last year's class and thought we could potentially 3D print our own stepper motor that has two degrees of freedom. 

Here is a picture of the codes:

Plans for next day: We will be trying out the fresnel reflector and print stuff!
