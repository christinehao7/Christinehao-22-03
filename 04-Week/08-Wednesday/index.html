On this day we worked on the solar tracker and tested the foam fresnel reflector with acrylic to see whether there is a point of reflection, where we can put the reflection mirror at. 

Beside that, we also worked on 3D printing, which I was very excited about.

We used the Prusa printers, and Nathan taught us how to operate them. We learned how to export meshes directly from Fusion 350 and send them to the Prusa application. Then we would use an SD card to import the files onto the printers themselves. The process was not hard to comprehend, but the printers were not always reliable (or it might have been our mistake). In the future, we have encountered several failed trials while using the Prusa printers, which was a great learning experience.
